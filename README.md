The code inherits the audited ICO codebase from VDice.io (https://blog.vdice.io/crowdsale-smart-contract-code-audits). Funds will be held in a 2-of-3 Multisig wallet derived from Parity's multisig wallet.

Code audit is still in the works. Code Coverage will be uploaded soon. 
Audit process will be updated on: https://dev.fundyourselfnow.com/ico/public/contract
